Started poorly:

    artificial intelligence
    UC Irvine
    Donald Bren
    Computer vision
    Computer science
    CS

    To make the above queries faster, we used champion lists to grab only top 50 postings with highest token freq. We also created lexicons ( index of index) to seek positions in indexes instead of going through each line.

    Effectiveness (content)
    Machine learning
    AI UCI
    Schedule of classes
    Databases

    To increase the quality of results for the queires above, we added weights to more important text (headers, titles, meta content) and added 2 gram indexing.
